# allmoji
A JSON document containing every emoji 12.0 character, shortname, and codepoints.

This document exists because the standard for shortnames is a problem. There are too many deviations and variations of the same emoji with a different name. 90% of the emoji libraries out there are out of date. This document aims to maintain a consistent naming scheme as well as support all future emojis, including the upcoming emoji 13.0 2020 release. All of the data in this document was scraped from emojipedia. I merely put it into a format exclusively for developers. You will find that keys are shortnames for quick lookup, and codepoints and the emoji's character as values. Should you require any other attributes, don't hesitate to inform me.
